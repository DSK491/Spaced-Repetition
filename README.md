# Spaced Repetition Tool

This Tool automates the 'Spaced Repetition' memory technique.

### About Spaced Repetition

Spaced Repetition is a memory technique that combats the Forgetting Curve (our memory of a topic is halved within days of learning it). </br>
It is a process usually done with flashcards, but creating flashcards is time consuming and is a big challenge for me.

### The Tool

I built this Tool to use the technique with notes.

This program reminds you occasionally to revisit topics learnt in the past.
(the default reminder interval is 1 day, 3 days and 15 days). </br>
You must *Add Data* to the program everyday and you will be reminded of the same in the future with the *View Data* function. </br>

### Usage

The tool opens with the *Main Menu*. Here you will be presented with multiple options.</br> The most commonly used functions will be the *Add Data* and *View/Log Data* submenus. </br>

To perform a function or to enter a submenu, you will need to type the *Index* associated with the submenu and hit *Enter*.</br></br>
*Example:*</br>
*1) Add Data*</br>
*2) View/Log Data*</br>
Here, the *Index* associated with the submenu *Add Data* is *1*.</br>
*Add Data* requests you for information on the data to be stored and is self explanatory. </br>
*View/Log Data* displays topics to be revisited on that day. </br>

*Test Mode* [*Main Menu* > *Modify Data* > *Test Mode*] pushes forward all reminders during test days. </br>
**Warning: *Test mode cannot be undone. Please duplicate the database file before using this feature.***
